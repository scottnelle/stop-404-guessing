# Stop 404 Guessing

Stop 404 Guessing prevents the WordPress Canonical Redirects feature from guessing what page a user might have wanted when they encounter a 404 error. Instead, it will show your 404 template, which may be less confusing and more helpful to the user as well as giving you an opportunity to track the source of the 404 with your analytics package and remedy the issue.
