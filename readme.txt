Prevent WordPress from guessing what a user meant and just show a 404 page.

== Description ==

Stop 404 Guessing prevents the Canonical Redirects feature from guessing what page a user might have wanted when they encounter a 404 error. Instead, it will show your 404 template, which may be less confusing and more helpful to the user as well as giving you an opportunity to track the source of the 404 with your analytics package and remedy the issue.


== Installation ==

1. Upload Stop 404 Guessing to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
